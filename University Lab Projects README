Overview:
These university projects show an understanding of both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Although drawn from academic experiments, the underlying techniques can be used to address real-world business challenges.

Purpose:
- Demonstrate core statistical concepts in action
- Provide clear, documented examples of hypothesis testing, regression, and exploratory analysis
- Highlight ability to interpret results and draw meaningful conclusions

Key Techniques Demonstrated:
- Descriptive Statistics: mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation
- Inferential Statistics: confidence intervals, p-values, multiple regression, t-tests, ANCOVA


Note:
These  projects are just two examples taken from a library of projects completed during the course of my BSc in Psychology.
This course has provided a strong foundational knowledge in a variety of quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods research methods and design.
